        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration and FinanceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a pre-business student at University of California, Riverside, my interest for business and finance has become my true passion. I enjoy managing group finances and making sure that the amount of materials purchased do not exceed the budget. Studying business with a minor in finance would allow me to gain the knowledge I need to successfully manage a business or help organizations control their costs and increase funds. My goal is to be in charge of a companyâ€™s finances or run my own business, which will cater to low income communities who would otherwise not be able to afford costly services. Thus, I hope to give back to my community while pursuing my dreams into my business pursuits. People often say that a certain place is like a second home to them, and more often than not, that place is somewhere they like to frequently visit or stay at. However, my second home is not a specific place, rather, it is a larger area and includes all the diverse groups of people living there. The second home I am referring to is my community. <br><br>

        In this community, there are public institutions that have been a large part of my childhood and made a profound impact on my daily life. In the beginning of my highschool years, I decided to give back to my community by volunteering at a public library, where I would encourage children to read many books and arrange events for them to participate in. Volunteering immediately became a pleasant activity as I would look forward to engaging with the children again. However, I noticed that there was a large number of homeless people that try to sit inside the library, only to be escorted outside. I thought about how it was unfair that the homeless were not able to stay at a place meant for public usage. Since they already did not have a home, how could they accept the community as their own if they are being rejected by it? <br><br>

        Hence, realizing that inequality and the mistreatment of homeless people is an overlooked issue in the community, I was inspired to volunteer at a homeless shelter. I worked with a group of people to serve food to the homeless. Everytime I handed a plate of food to them, they would thank me and show their appreciation with a warm smile, which made me happy since I was able to provide them with a place and environment where they will always be accepted. I now understand that my role in this community is to make others feel included. If I am able to call my community a second home, other people should be able to call their community a second -- or even first -- home as well.
